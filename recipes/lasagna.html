<h3>Ingredients for Cheese Sauce</h3>

<ul>15 oz reduced fat ricotta cheese</ul>
<ul>1 large egg</ul>
<ul>2 Tbsp parsley finely chopped, plus more to garnish</ul>

<h2>Substitue for Red Wine?</h2>
<p>If you don't have red wine on hand, or prefer not to use it, you can substitute with beef broth or beef stock.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h4>How to Make Meat Sauce:</h4> 
<ol>Place a deep pan or dutch oven over medium/high heat and add 1 Tbsp olive oil, 1 lb ground beef and diced onion. Saute, breaking up the meat, for 5 minutes or until beef is no longer pink. Add pressed garlic and sauté another minute until fragrant.</ol>
<ol>Add 1/4 cup wine and stir for 2 minutes or until wine is nearly evaporated. Add 3 cups marinara, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp sugar and 2 Tbsp parsley. Bring to a simmer then cover and cook 5 minutes.</ol>

<h4>How to Make Cheese Sauce:</h4>
<ol>In a large mixing bowl, combine 16 oz Cottage Cheese, 15 oz Ricotta, 1 cup mozzarella, 1 egg and 2 Tbsp parsley. Mix well</ol>

<h4>How to Make Lasagna:</h4>
<ol>Preheat oven to 375˚F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and 9 lasagna noodles. Cook until al dente according to package instructions.</ol>
<ol>Spread 1/2 cup meat sauce in the bottom of a deep 9x13 casserole dish.
    Add 3 noodles, spread on 1/3 of the meat sauce and sprinkle with 1 cup mozarella cheese. Spoon on and spread the top with 1/2 of your cheese sauce. </ol>
<ol>Repeat until you have 3 layers of noodles:
    Add 3 noodles, 1/3 meat sauce, 1 cup mozarella cheese, 1/2 cheese sauce
    Add 3 noodles, remaining 1/3 meat sauce, remaining 1 cup mozarella.</ol>
<ol>Poke 9-12 toothpicks over the surface of your lasagna (to keep the foil from sticking to the cheese). Cover with foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes.</ol>    
<ol>Remove foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese turns golden. Let lasagna rest 30 min before slicing.</ol>
